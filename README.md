# MNIST Dataset Classification using First principles

## Dataset 
We are using the popular MNIST Dataset for classification. This data set
has many images of handwritten digits 0 to 9. i.e., 10
classes. Each image is of size 28 Ã— 28. In our subset there
are 7000 images in total from 10 classes, out of which 6000
are for training and 1000 are for testing.

## Classification
### Probabilistic Methods
- MAP 
- MLE
- Bayesian Pairwise Voting
- Simple Perpendicular Bisectors

### Nearest Neighbour Based Methods
- NN Classification
- Reverse NN based outlier detection
